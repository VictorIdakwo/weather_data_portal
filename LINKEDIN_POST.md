## 🌍 Proud to Announce: Weather Data Portal for Africa!

I'm excited to share my latest project - a comprehensive **Weather Data Portal** covering all **54 African countries** with unprecedented granularity!

### 🎯 **What It Does:**
A one-stop platform for accessing weather and climate data from multiple authoritative sources including NASA POWER, Google Earth Engine (MODIS, CHIRPS, ERA5-Land), and OpenWeather API.

### 🗺️ **Geographic Coverage:**
✅ **54 African countries**
✅ **400+ administrative divisions** (States, Regions, Provinces, Counties)
✅ **300+ Nigerian LGAs** - complete coverage of all 37 states
✅ **3-level hierarchy** - From continental to neighborhood-level data

### 🛰️ **Data Sources Integrated:**
🔹 **NASA POWER** - Global weather and climate parameters
🔹 **MODIS** - Satellite-based land surface temperature & vegetation indices
🔹 **CHIRPS** - Precipitation data via Google Earth Engine
🔹 **ERA5-Land** - High-resolution climate reanalysis
🔹 **OpenWeather API** - Real-time weather data

### 💡 **Key Features:**
• Multi-country simultaneous data retrieval
• Flexible temporal resolution (daily, monthly, annual)
• Multiple export formats (CSV, Excel, GeoJSON, Shapefile)
• Custom shapefile upload support
• Sub-national granularity (e.g., Lagos LGAs, Nairobi Sub-counties)
• Built with Python, Streamlit, and Google Earth Engine

### 🎓 **Use Cases:**
📊 Climate research and analysis
🌾 Agricultural planning and monitoring
🏥 Public health studies (heat stress, vector-borne diseases)
🏙️ Urban planning and heat island analysis
📈 Environmental impact assessments

### 🔧 **Tech Stack:**
Python | Streamlit | Google Earth Engine | NASA APIs | GeoPandas | Pandas | Earth Engine API

### 🌟 **What Makes It Special:**
This isn't just another weather app - it's designed specifically for African data needs:
- Respects regional administrative structures (States for Nigeria, Counties for Kenya, Provinces for South Africa, etc.)
- Covers countries often overlooked in commercial solutions
- Free and open-source
- Neighborhood-level granularity for major cities

### 📊 **By The Numbers:**
• 54 Countries
• 400+ Divisions
• 400+ Sub-divisions
• 5 Data Sources
• 10,600+ Lines of Code
• 100% African Coverage

### 🚀 **Live & Open Source:**
The portal is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and available for anyone to use. Full source code is on GitHub for researchers, developers, and organizations to adapt for their needs.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/VictorIdakwo/weather_data_portal

### 🙏 **Acknowledgments:**
Built with support from open data initiatives: NASA POWER, Google Earth Engine, CHIRPS, and the global open-source community.

### 💬 **Looking Forward:**
I'm particularly interested in collaborations with:
- Climate researchers across Africa
- Public health organizations
- Agricultural development agencies
- Urban planners and policymakers
- Data scientists working on African climate data

Whether you're studying heat stress in Lagos, monitoring drought in the Sahel, analyzing rainfall patterns in East Africa, or planning climate-resilient infrastructure - this tool is for you!

**Let's leverage data to build a more climate-resilient Africa!** 🌍
