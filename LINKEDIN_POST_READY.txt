🌍 Excited to Announce: Weather Data Portal for Africa! 🌍

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a comprehensive weather and climate data platform covering all 54 African countries with unprecedented granularity!

🎯 WHAT IT DOES:
A one-stop platform for accessing authoritative weather and climate data from multiple sources including NASA POWER, Google Earth Engine (MODIS, CHIRPS, ERA5-Land), and OpenWeather API.

🗺️ GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE:
✅ All 54 African countries
✅ 400+ administrative divisions (States, Regions, Provinces, Counties)
✅ 300+ Nigerian LGAs - complete coverage of all 37 states
✅ 3-level hierarchy - from continental to neighborhood-level data

🛰️ DATA SOURCES:
• NASA POWER - Global weather and climate parameters
• MODIS - Satellite-based land surface temperature & vegetation
• CHIRPS - Precipitation data via Google Earth Engine
• ERA5-Land - High-resolution climate reanalysis
• OpenWeather API - Real-time weather data

💡 KEY FEATURES:
• Multi-country simultaneous data retrieval
• Flexible temporal resolution (daily, monthly, annual)
• Multiple export formats (CSV, Excel, GeoJSON, Shapefile)
• Custom shapefile upload support
• Sub-national granularity (Lagos LGAs, Nairobi Sub-counties, etc.)

🎓 USE CASES:
📊 Climate research and analysis
🌾 Agricultural planning and monitoring
🏥 Public health studies (heat stress, vector-borne diseases)
🏙️ Urban planning and heat island analysis
📈 Environmental impact assessments

🔧 TECH STACK:
Python | Streamlit | Google Earth Engine | NASA APIs | GeoPandas | Pandas

🌟 WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL:
• Designed specifically for African data needs
• Respects regional administrative structures
• Covers countries often overlooked in commercial solutions
• Free and open-source
• Neighborhood-level granularity for major cities

📊 BY THE NUMBERS:
• 54 Countries
• 400+ Divisions
• 400+ Sub-divisions
• 5 Data Sources
• 10,600+ Lines of Code
• 100% African Coverage

🚀 LIVE & OPEN SOURCE:
The portal is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and available for anyone to use. Full source code is on GitHub for researchers, developers, and organizations.

💬 LOOKING FOR COLLABORATIONS WITH:
• Climate researchers across Africa
• Public health organizations
• Agricultural development agencies
• Urban planners and policymakers
• Data scientists working on African climate data

Whether you're studying heat stress in Lagos, monitoring drought in the Sahel, analyzing rainfall patterns in East Africa, or planning climate-resilient infrastructure - this tool is for you!

Let's leverage data to build a more climate-resilient Africa! 🌍
